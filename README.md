# ☁️ Cloud Migration Planner: 
 Discription

  A Python-based tool to help organizations **compare cloud service providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP) based on key service-level metrics like compute cost, storage cost, latency, and availability. This helps in        making informed decisions when planning cloud migration. 🚀
🎯 Objective

 - Provide a **decision-making tool** for choosing the best cloud provider.
 - Compare providers based on **cost, performance, and availability**.
 - Help organizations **plan efficient cloud migration** strategies.

📝 Features

 - Compare multiple cloud providers side by side
 - Calculate weighted scores based on **user-defined priorities**
 - Rank providers based on overall performance
 - Export results to CSV for reporting

⚙️ Technologies Used

 - Python 3.x 🐍
 - Pandas library for data handling 📊

⚙️ Setup & Initialization

  1️⃣ Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-migration-planner.git
   cd cloud-migration-planner
 2️⃣ Install dependencies
   bash
   Copy code
   pip install pandas
 3️⃣ Run the planner
   bash
   Copy code
   python cloud_migration_planner.py
 4️⃣ View results

   Ranked cloud providers appear in the terminal

   Results are saved to cloud_service_comparison.csv

📊 How It Works

 1. Define cloud service providers and their metrics:

| Provider | Compute ($/hr) | Storage ($/GB/mo) | Latency (ms) | Availability (%) |
|----------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| AWS      | 0.05           | 0.023            | 50           | 99.9           |
| Azure    | 0.045          | 0.020            | 55           | 99.95          |
| GCP      | 0.048          | 0.026            | 60           | 99.9           |

2. Assign **weights** to each parameter based on importance (sum should be 1.0).  
   Example:
   ```python
   weights = {
       "Compute": 0.4,
       "Storage": 0.2,
       "Latency": 0.2,
       "Availability": 0.2
   }
3.The tool calculates normalized scores and total weighted scores for each provider.

4.Providers are ranked according to their Total Score.
